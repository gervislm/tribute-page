      <h3 id="headline">Here's a time line of Dr. Fernández's life:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>1924</strong> - Born in La Cañada de Urdaneta, Zulia, Venezuela.</li>
        <li><strong>1944</strong> - He graduated as a medical surgeon and doctor of medical sciences.</li>
        <li><strong>1945</strong> - Complete an internship in neurology and neuropathology at George Washington University.</li>
        <li><strong>1946</strong> - Did a neurosurgery residency at Serafimer Hospital in Stockholm with neurosurgeon Herbert Olivecrona.</li>
        <li><strong>1947</strong> - He worked as a researcher in the area of Electron Microscopy at the Nobel Institute of Physics.</li>
        <li><strong>1948</strong> - He worked as a researcher at the Institute for Cellular and Genetic Research, part of the Karolinska Institutet in Stockholm.</li>
        <li><strong>1951</strong> - He received a master's degree in cell biology and the following year his doctorate in biophysics from Stockholm University.</li>
        <li><strong>1952</strong> - He received his doctorate in biophysics from Stockholm University.</li>
        <li><strong>1955</strong> - He patented the diamond-tipped scalpel.</li>
        <li><strong>1959</strong> - He contributed to the use of cryofixation and low-temperature preparation techniques using helium II, applying them to the study of tissue ultrastructure. Likewise, he made important contributions to the knowledge of the structure of the nerve.</li>
        <li><strong>1960</strong> - He proposed for the first time to directly observe hydrated frozen samples (frozen-hydrated), building the first cryo-electron microscope and the first cryo-sample holder, with which he introduces the concept of cryo-electron microscopy being considered by Harvard University in the list of the 100 scholars who contributed the most to scientific development in the last century.</li>
        <li><strong>1970</strong> - He is hired by NASA to work on the Apollo project in the field of physical-chemical analysis of lunar rocks.</li>
        <li><strong>1979</strong> - Presented at the first Venezuelan and Latin American Congress of Neurosciences (Maracaibo 1979) the advances in research on the molecular organization of cell membranes analyzed with the proposed technique.</li>
        <li><strong>1998</strong> - The IVIC creates the Humberto Fernández Center for Structural Biology with the aim of interpreting biological phenomena at a molecular level through a wide range of studies of the structure of proteins, nucleic acids, membranes, organelles and viruses using techniques such as cryo-electron microscopy , digital image processing, nuclear magnetic resonance, small angle X-ray diffraction and X-ray crystallography.</li>
        <li><strong>1999</strong> - Fernández died in Stockholm, the product of a brain aneurysm.</li>
      </ul>
